LocalIncomeRisk

Research project studying local income risk and household financial decisions

This project is still vaguely defined - I will be exploring existing literature, acquiring and playing with datasets, and refining the research question as I go.

The basic idea is to construct measures of local income risk, and study household financial decisions.  To households recognize the income risk they face and adjust their financial decisions accordingly?  What factors or attributes (both attributes of the households and of the geographic area) determine household's ability to optimally share risk or insure against income risk?
